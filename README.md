This project is based on the Spring Cloud tests project for an issue with turning off hystrix request context properties. I have created a custom concurrency strategy to allow for the passing of MDC parameters as covered in [Netflix Hystrix Issue #92](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/issues/92) . That results in the request log being turned on. I can't do the request context fix as I have other aysnc code that appears to lose that context when I try and add it to a filter. I should be able to turn off the request log and as long as I don't use cache or collapser, I should be fine (see [HystrixRequestContext javadoc](http://netflix.github.io/Hystrix/javadoc/index.html?com/netflix/hystrix/strategy/concurrency/HystrixRequestContext.html) ). I've tried turning the request log off via application.properties and via HystrixCommandProperties as covered in the [wiki](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Configuration#request-context) but I still get the  HystrixRequestContext.initializeContext() must be called ... exception
